# TipTool - A simple tip calculator written in Ionic 2.

This is a really simple app I wrote in the [ionic 2 framework](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2). It calculates 15% tips based on a bill amount.

### Build for Android

In the root directory of the project.

`ionic add platform android`

Once this completes, build the APK with the command

`ionic build android`

This will generate an apk in the directory

`tipTool/platforms/android/build/outputs/apk`

To run directly in a device connected via adb, run the command

`ionic run android`

### Building for other platforms

Have not done this yet. Look at the ionic docs for more details.
